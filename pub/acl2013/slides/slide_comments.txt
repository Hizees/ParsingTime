  Roadmap between sections
x combination mechanism is well-defined
x vspace in slide 3 between examples
x emphasize model / representation
x test -- emphasize that we're using gold mentions




x take out training accuracy
x  2 uses (conclusion):
x  	guesses on everything 
x  	gives a distribution at end
  Emphasize language independence
  make sexier
  	conceptual reasons to prefer:
  		more being learned
  	looking for cool types of combinations
x  Don't give the whole grammar
  	e.g., rules that are tedious that get tedious
  Have a complicated running example
x Days away rather than days






















x Motivation with more of an outline (e.g., note that it's probabilistic)
x More motivation examples


















x  2 lines for title
x  no outline
   
?  temporal motivation use only IE
?  	When an event happened
?  	Meetings / correspondence
   
x  motivation for particular approach
x  	"how is it done now and why is it not sufficient"
x  	compare to how things are done now
x  	usefulness of recursive structure
x  sprinkle related work around the slide
   
x   less animation on the types figure
   
x   lexical values -> lexical categories
x   explain sequences spawning from numbers versus words (e.g., March vs. DOM(3))
x   	difference between converting march to NUM-march
   
x   Mention that gaussian is an easy choice
x   	sufficient, easy to learn approximation
   
x   Write grounded times (versus phrases) in ISO-ish format
   
x   Training-EM
x   	write with regular probabilities rather than switching from log probs
   
x   Results: systems are not given additional context, which hurts previous systems
x   	especially, that we force parsing everything
   
x   Spacial -> spatial
   
x   Motivate relative to GeoQueries etc
x   	for us, less direct mapping between language and grounding
x   	other half of previous work can go here
x   	put up a geoqueries example and a time example in parallel
