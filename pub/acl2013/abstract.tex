We present a discriminative, language independent semantic parser
  for learning the interpretation of temporal phrases
	given only a corpus of utterances and the times they reference.
We employ a latent parse encoding a language-flexible representation of
  time, and learn parameters on features of the parse and associated temporal
  value.
The parameters of the model are learnedusing a loosely supervised bootstrapping
  approach using a $k$-best discriminative parser, without lexical cues or
  language-specific tuning.
We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on all languages in the
  \tempeval\ temporal normalization task, reporting a $4\%$ improvement in
  both English and Spanish accuracy, and novel
  results for four other languages.
