\Section{conclusion}{Conclusion}
We present a discriminative, multilingual approach to resolving
  temporal expressions, using a language-flexible latent parse and rich
  features on both the \textit{types} and \textit{values} of partial
  derivations in the parse.
We show state-of-the-art results on both languages in \tempeval\ with prior
  work, and present results on four additional languages.
