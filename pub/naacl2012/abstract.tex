We present a probabilistic approach to interpreting temporal phrases
	given a corpus of utterances and the times they reference.
We approach the problem by defining a compositional \textit{grammar} of time.
This grammar is used to construct a \textit{latent parse} representing
	the phrase and evaluating to the time the phrase would represent.
In this way, we can employ a distantly supervised EM-esque bootstrapping
	approach to learning these latent parses while capturing both syntactic
	uncertainty and pragmatic ambiguity in a probabilistic framework.
We achieve an accuracy of \todo{X\%} on the \dataset{TempEval-2} task --
	comparable to state of the art systems.
