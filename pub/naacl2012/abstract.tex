We present a probabilistic approach to resolving temporal phrases
	given a corpus of utterances and the times they reference.
We approach the problem by defining a compositional \textit{grammar of time}.
This grammar is used to construct a \textit{latent parse} which represents
	the meaning phrase and evaluates to the time the phrase would represent,
	as a logical parse might evaluate to a concrete entity.
In this way, we can employ a distantly supervised EM-\textit{esque} 
	bootstrapping approach to learn these latent parses while capturing both 
	syntactic uncertainty and pragmatic ambiguity in a probabilistic framework.
We achieve an accuracy of 71\% on an adapted \dataset{TempEval-2} task --
	comparable to state of the art systems.
