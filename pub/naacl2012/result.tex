\Section{result}{Evaluation}
We evaluate our model against current state-of-the art systems for temporal
	resolution on the English portion of the \tempeval\ Task A dataset
	\cite{key:2010verhagen-tempeval}.
%We describe the dataset in \refsec{result-dataset}, and detail the previous
%	work and our results in \refsec{result-scores}.

\Subsection{result-dataset}{Dataset}
The \tempeval\ dataset is relatively small,
	containing 162 documents and 1052 temporal phrases in the training set
	and an additional 20 documents and 156 phrases in the evaluation set.
Each temporal phrase was annotated as a \timex\footnote{
		See \url{http://www.timeml.org} for details on the TimeML format and
		\timex\ tag.
	}
	tag around an adverbial or prepositional phrase

% -- Evaluation task
In the \tempeval\ A Task, system performance is evaluated on 
	detection and resolution of expressions.
Since we perform only the second of these, we evaluate our system
	assuming gold detection.
%Thus, only the \timex\ attribute evaluation is compared against.

	A precision-recall curve for our system, compared to prior work.
	The data points are obtained by setting a threshold minimum probability
		at which to guess a time creating different extent recall values. 
	The curve falls below \sys{HeidelTime1} and \sys{SUTime} in part from
		lack of context, and in part since our system was not trained to
		optimize this curve.
}

% -- Scoring Tweak
Similarly, the original \tempeval\ scoring scheme gave a precision 
	and recall for detection, and an accuracy for only the temporal expressions 
	attempted.
Since our system is able to produce a guess for every expression, we produce
	a precision-recall curve on which competing systems are plotted
	(see \reffig{pr}).
Note that the downward slope of the curve indicates that the probabilities
	returned by the system are indicative of its confidence -- the probability
	of a parse correlates with the probability of that parse being correct.

Additionally, and perhaps more accurately, we compare to 
	previous system scores when constrained to make a prediction on every
	example; if no guess is made, the output is considered incorrect.
This in general yields lower results, as the system is not allowed to
	abstain on expressions it does not recognize.
% -- Reference Table
Results are summarized in \reftab{results}.

% -- Systems
We compare to three previous rule-based systems.
%(GUTime)
\sys{GUTime} \cite{key:2000mani-temporal} presents an older but widely
	used baseline.\footnote{
		Due to discrepancies in output formats, 
			the output of \sys{GUTime} was heuristically patched
			and manually checked to conform to the expected format.
	}
%(SuTime)
More recently, \sys{SUTime} \cite{key:2012chang-temporal} 
	provides a much stronger comparison.
%(HeidelTime)
We also compare to \sys{HeidelTime} \cite{key:2010strotgen-temporal}, 
	which represents the state-of-the-art system at the \tempeval\ task.

\Subsection{result-detection}{Detection}
One of the advantages of our model is that it can provide candidate groundings for any
	expression.
We explore this ability by building a detection model to find candidate temporal
	expressions, which we then ground.
The detection model is implemented as a Conditional Random Field \cite{key:2001lafferty-crf}, 
	with features over the morphology and context.
Particularly, we define the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item The word and lemma within 2 of the current word.
\item The word shape\footnote{
		Word shape is calculated by mapping each character to one of uppercase, lowercase, number,
			or punctuation.
		The first four characters are mapped verbatim; subsequent sequences of similar characters
			are collapsed.
	}
	and part of speech of the current word.
\item Whether the current word is a number, along with its ordinality and order of magnitude
\item Prefixes and suffixes up to length 5, along with their word shape.
\end{itemize}

	}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

We summarize our results in \reftab{detection}, noting that the performance indicates that
	the CRF and interpretation model find somewhat different phrases hard to detect and
	interpret respectively.
Many errors made in detection are attributable to the small size of the training
	corpus (63,000 tokens).

\Subsection{result-error}{Discussion}
% -- Our Results
Our system performs well above the \sys{GUTime} baseline and is competitive
	with both of the more recent systems.
% -- Improvements
In part, this is from more sophisticated modeling of syntactic ambiguity:
	e.g., \tp{the past few weeks} has a clause \tp{the past} -- which, alone,
	should be parsed as \te{PAST} -- yet the system correctly disprefers
	incorporating this interpretation and 
	returns the approximate duration \te{~1 week}.
Furthermore, we often capture cases of pragmatic ambiguity -- for example,
	empirically, \tp{August} tends to refers to the previous August when mentioned in
	February.

% -- Errors
%(only us)
%We attribute most errors the system makes which rule-based systems would not
Compared to rule-based systems, we attribute most errors the system makes
	to either data sparsity or missing lexical primitives.
For example -- illustrating sparsity -- we have trouble recognizing \tp{Nov.} as corresponding
	to \te{November} (e.g., \tp{Nov.\ 13}), since the publication time of the articles happen to
	often be near November and we prefer tagging the word as \te{Nil} (analogous to 
	\tp{the \th{13}}).
Missing lexical primitives, in turn, include tags for \tp{1990s}, or \tp{half}
	(in \tp{minute and a half}); as well as missing functions, such as
	\tp{or} (in \tp{weeks or months}).

%(also rule-based)
Remaining errors can be attributed to causes such as providing the wrong Viterbi grounding
	to the evaluation script (e.g., last rather than this Friday), differences in 
	annotation (e.g., 24 hours is marked wrong against a day), or missing context 
	(e.g., the publication time is not the true reference time), among others.
