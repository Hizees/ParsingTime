\Section{conclude}{Conclusion}
We present a new approach to resolving temporal expressions,
	based on synchronous parsing of a fixed grammar with learned parameters
	and a compositional representation of time.
The system allows for output which captures uncertainty both with respect to 
	the syntactic structure of the phrase and the pragmatic ambiguity of 
	temporal utterances.
We also note that the approach is theoretically better adapted for
	phrases more complex than those found in \tempeval.

Its probabilistic nature gives the system a unique usefulness
	in tasks such as detecting temporal expressions, making probabilistic
	sequence models more practical, or propagating uncertainty as a
	component in larger systems.
Furthermore, the system makes very few language-specific assumptions,
	and the algorithm could be adapted to domains beyond temporal resolution.

We hope to address the task of detection and explore system performance
	on multilingual and complex datasets in future work.
