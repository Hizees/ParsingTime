\Section{conclude}{Conclusion}
We present a distantly supervised approach to resolving temporal expressions,
	based on synchronous parsing of a fixed grammar with learned parameters
	and a compositional representation of time.
In addition to providing results competitive with the state of the art,
	the system allows for output which captures uncertainty both with respect to 
	the syntactic structure of the phrase and the pragmatic ambiguity of 
	temporal utterances.

This probabilistic nature gives the system a unique usefulness
	in tasks such as detection of temporal expressions, making probabilistic
	sequence models more practical, or propagating uncertainty as a
	component in larger systems.
Furthermore, the system makes very few language-specific assumptions,
	and the algorithm could be applied to domains beyond temporal resolution.
